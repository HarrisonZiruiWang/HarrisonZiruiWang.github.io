## Advice on how to get into a Finance (Business/Economics) PhD program

Getting into a top Finance (Economics) Ph.D. program is hard. It requires research experiences and strong recommendation letters by professors to show that one has research potential. When you are still at colleges or universities, a research assistantship is the best way to gain some research experience. Taking some PhD-level courses and doing well in them will show the admission committee that you are prepared for the first two-year coursework. Having a strong mathematical background is important because the coursework at Ph.D. programs is heavily proof-driven. If you are out of school or want to gain more research experience prior to applying to Ph.D. programs, you can work as a full-time research assistant (pre-doc). You can find some job opportunities on the <a href="https://predoc.org/opportunities" target="_black">PREDOC</a> or <a href="https://www.nber.org/career-resources/research-assistant-positions-not-nber" target="_black">NBER</a> page. Thanks to Prof Joseph Engelberg and Prof Baolian Wang, who gave me a lot of genuine advice when I was applying for a Ph.D. program. Here are a few links that are also helpful.
