## Past Research Experience

<ins>Reasearch Assistant supervised by Prof. Joseph Engelberg</ins>

I have been <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/engelberg/pub/portfolios/index.htm" target="_blank">Professor Joseph Engelberg</a>â€™s Reasearch Assistant for his <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/engelberg/pub/portfolios/PDDE.pdf" target="_blank">Portfolio-Driven Disposition Effect (PDDE) paper</a> which is currently under revision at the Journal of Finance. The PDDE is the observation that investors have a strong disposition effect when their portfolio is at a loss and have almost no disposition effect when it is at a gain. To shed light on this effect, I used Node.js and PostgreSQL to develop an online experiment that simulates the changes in the net worth of a stock portfolio and enables participants to make trading decisions among four stocks. The experiment has been run on thousands of participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk and a similar platform for Chinese users. 

Recently, I start to help Prof Engelberg on collecting data from the Web of Science. Using dynamic web scraping in Python, I downloaded the data of more than 28,000 papers from 65 journals.

<ins>Reasearch Assistant supervised by Prof. Alexis Akira Toda</ins>

Each day I updated a model that predicted the course of the COVID-19 pandemic via MATLAB code and updated the data visualization on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aatoda111/home" target="_blank">Professor Alexis Toda</a>'s research page.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
