## Past Research Experience

<ins>Reasearch Assistant supervised by Prof. Joseph Engelberg</ins>

During my junior and senior years at UCSD, I have been <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/engelberg/pub/portfolios/index.htm" target="_blank">Professor Joseph Engelberg</a>â€™s Reasearch Assistant for his <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/engelberg/pub/portfolios/PDDE.pdf" target="_blank">Portfolio-Driven Disposition Effect (PDDE) paper</a> which is currently under revision at the Journal of Finance. The PDDE is the observation that investors have a strong disposition effect when their portfolio is at a loss and have almost no disposition effect when it is at a gain. To shed light on this effect, I used Node.js and PostgreSQL to develop an <a href="https://gamestocktrading.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">online experiment</a> that simulates the changes in the net worth of a stock portfolio and enables participants to make trading decisions among four stocks. The experiment has been run on thousands of participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk and <a href="https://stocktradinggame-chinese.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">a similar platform for Chinese users</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/HarrisonZiruiWang/stocktradinggame" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>)

Recently, I start to help Prof Engelberg on collecting data from the Web of Science. Using dynamic web scraping in Python, I downloaded the data of more than 280,000 papers from 65 journals. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Osw5JYMwvkv1bYBbtImAW9E6M0ebmUJy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Data</a>)

<ins>Reasearch Assistant supervised by Prof. Alexis Akira Toda</ins>

I also worked as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aatoda111/home" target="_blank">Professor Alexis Akira Toda</a>'s research assistant between April and
August 2020. Each day I run a model that predicted the course of the COVID-19 pandemic via MATLAB code and updated the data visualization on Professor Toda's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aatoda111/misc/covid19" target="_blank">research page</a>.
